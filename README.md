# mini-loan-app-mernStack

Creating a mini loan app with MERN stack and implementing features like JWT authentication, user roles, Redux for state management, Reactstrap for styling, and admin functionalities is a valuable experience to showcase on your resume.

# Project Title: Mini Loan Application

Description: Developed a mini loan application using the MERN stack with JWT authentication to provide a secure platform for users to apply for loans. Implemented admin features to manage loan applications and change loan status.


# Key Achievements:

User Authentication: Implemented user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and cookies, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and utilize the loan application features.

Role-Based Access Control: Designed and implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish between regular users and administrators. Admins have the privilege to change loan status.

Redux State Management: Utilized Redux to efficiently manage and share application state across components, enhancing data flow and user experience.

Responsive UI Design: Employed Reactstrap, a popular UI library for React, to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface, enhancing user interaction and accessibility.

Loan Application Workflow: Developed a streamlined loan application workflow that guides users through the process of applying for loans, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Admin Functionality: Created an admin dashboard with the capability to view and manage loan applications, change loan statuses, and make informed decisions.

API Integration: Interfaced with backend APIs for handling user authentication, loan application submission, and admin functionalities, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

Deployment: Successfully deployed the application to a web server, making it accessible to users for testing and evaluation.


# Technologies Used:  MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), JWT Authentication, Redux, Reactstrap, Axios, Cookies, RESTful APIs.

Outcome: Built a fully functional mini loan application that offers a secure and efficient loan application process for users while providing administrators with the necessary tools to manage loan applications effectively.

Lessons Learned: Gained expertise in full-stack development, user authentication, role-based access control, state management, and UI design. Enhanced problem-solving skills by addressing complex loan application workflows and user interactions.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` for frontend this will in frontend directory

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run dev` for backend - this wiil be in root directory

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
